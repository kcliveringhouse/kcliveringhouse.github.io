						<h3 align="middle">The Anniversary Trip</h3>
						<p align="middle">Krista and Casey planned a trip up north to Tofte, MN for their three year anniversary. The drive up north was filled with torrential rain making Casey nervous about his plan to propose in an outdoor setting. The drive up north is filled with long tunnels built into the rocky hillsides so that cars can maneuver along Lake Superior. Krista’s childhood was filled with trips to Tofte where she and her sister would hold their breath while passing through the tunnels and make a wish. The concept was that if you held your breath through the entirety of the tunnel your wish would come true. Krista and Casey did this as well. Casey was wishing for the rain to stop and Krista was wishing for Casey to ask her to marry him. Both of these wishes came true!</p>

						<p align="middle">Once they made it to Bluefin Bay Resort they enjoyed a few drinks at the resorts bar. During this time the rain cleared up and the sun came out. It was the perfect Tofte weather that Krista grew up loving.</p>

						<h3 align="middle">The Engagement</h3>
						<p align="middle">Casey suggested that they go for a walk and enjoy the beautiful weather. The two made it to an alcove that Krista had many childhood memories climbing on the rocks with her sister, Katy. Casey began to express how happy he was that they had been together for three years and that he hoped to spend many, many more with Krista. At that moment Casey got down on one knee which brought Krista to tears and asked her to marry him. Presenting a ring Casey had picked out all on his own. Krista said yes between the tears and the two went on to enjoy a special evening including calling family members and a dinner with a gorgeous view of Lake Superior! </p>
